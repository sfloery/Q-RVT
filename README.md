# Q-RVT

QGIS3 Plugin for using the Relief Visualization Toolbox from within QGIS3

### Prerequisites

[QGIS3.x](https://qgis.org/) <br/>
[RVT](https://iaps.zrc-sazu.si/en/rvt#v)

### Installing

As this is a prerelease, for the moment download the repository as .zip. Extract the .zip and rename the folder contained to "q_rvt" and zip it again. You now should have a .zip named "q_rvt". Now you can use QGIS3 to install the plugin using the newly created .zip. As soon as we reach the first stable release it will be possible to access the plugin from the qgis plugin repository.

###Getting started
After installing the plugin on its first startup you will be prompted to select the directory which contains the RVT Installation. All additional python packages will be downloaded automatically.
