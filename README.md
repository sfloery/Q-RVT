# Q-RVT

QGIS3 Plugin for using the Relief Visualization Toolbox from within QGIS3

### Prerequisites

QGIS3.x \n
RVT

### Installing

As this is a prerelease, just download the repository as .zip. Rename both the .zip itself and the folder contained to "q_rvt" and zip it again using this name. Now you can use QGIS3 to install the plugin using the newly created .zip. As soon as we reach the first stable release it will be possible to access the plugin from the qgis plugin repository.
